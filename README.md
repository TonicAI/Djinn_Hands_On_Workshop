# Welcome to the Djinn Hands-On Workshop!

We are so excited to share Tonic's latest offering tailored specifically to the needs of data scientists with you. 

## What is Djinn?
Djinn by Tonic is an AI-powered synthetic data platform that learns the unique patterns and properties of your proprietary datasets and generates completely new data. Here at Tonic, we recognize that data scientists face challenges unique from those faced by developers, requiring data of impeccable quality to build smarter models faster and derive better business insights. We built Djinn to address these challenges, allowing teams to optimize their data science workflows and achieve better results. All you have to do is connect your database and write a SQL query for Djinn to pull in the data you want to work with and start generating fake data. 

## Before the workshop... 
Please download the zip file containing a CSV of the dataset we will be working with as well as a jupyter notebook where we will pull in our synthetic data from Djinn. 

Feel free to [make your Djinn account](https://djinn.tonic.ai/login?signup=true) ahead of the workshop and start exploring the platform.
