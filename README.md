# Welcome to the Djinn Hands-On Workshop!

We are so excited to share Djinn with you, Tonic's latest offering tailored specifically to the needs of data scientists. 

## What is Djinn?
Djinn by Tonic is an AI-powered synthetic data platform that learns the unique patterns and properties of your proprietary datasets and generates completely new data. Here at Tonic, we recognize that data scientists face challenges unique from those faced by developers, requiring data of impeccable quality to build smarter models faster and derive better business insights. We built Djinn to address these challenges, allowing teams to optimize their data science workflows and achieve better results. All you have to do is connect your database and write a SQL query for Djinn to pull in the data you want to work with and start generating fake data. 

## For the workshop... 
Please download the CSV of the dataset we will be using as well as the Jupyter Notebook we will be working in so you can follow along.

Feel free to [make your Djinn account](https://djinn.tonic.ai/login?signup=true) now and start exploring the platform.
