# Welcome to the Djinn Hands-On Workshop!

We are so excited to share Djinn with you, Tonic's latest offering tailored specifically to the needs of data scientists. 

## What is Djinn?
Djinn by Tonic is an AI-powered synthetic data platform that learns the unique patterns and properties of your proprietary datasets and generates completely new data. Here at Tonic, we recognize that data scientists face challenges unique from those faced by developers, requiring data of impeccable quality to build smarter models faster and derive better business insights. We built Djinn to address these challenges, allowing teams to optimize their data science workflows and achieve better results. All you have to do is connect your database and write a SQL query for Djinn to pull in the data you want to work with and start generating fake data. 

## For the workshop... 
Please download the CSVs of the dataset: 
- telco_clean.csv is the full cleaned dataset
- telco_train.csv is the training dataset we will load into Djinn and train our models on 
- telco_test.csv is the testing dataset we will use to score our models

Please also download the Jupyter Notebook here so you can follow along. 

Feel free to [make your Djinn account](https://djinn.tonic.ai/login?signup=true) now and start exploring the platform.
